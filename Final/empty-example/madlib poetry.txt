Across the land came a adjective word
When the earth verb bare and lonely,
And I sit and verb of the joyous noun,
For it was I who heard, I only!
Then noun came by, of the gladsome days,
Of amount a wayside posy;
For a noun verb where the wild noun sleeps,
And the willow wands are adjective!
